# Tezos-Unity-WebGL-Wallet


Only works for WebGL builds in Unity 2021.2.7 or higher. Be sure to use the "Test1" WebGL template in the "Player" settings in "Project Settings" in Unity.
To add more functions, edit the .jslib file and add a wrapper to the "javascriptwraps.cs" C# file. From there, you just have to call the wrapped method
and it will execute the javascript function.

More functions and documentation soon.
